Every month of May, the Eurovision Song Contest gathers an audience of hundreds of million viewers in Europe and around the world. Months of anticipation leading up to a week-long competition with three televised shows where everything can happen. It is hard to define what is it that makes Eurovision so unique. But the truth is it has always remained aware of its status as the greatest non-sporting event in the world, while never taking itself too seriously. And that might be the key to its success.

Some people tune in at the last minute because they grew up watching the show every year. They might find some comfort in knowing who will win this time — all the while complaining about its decline since the good old days. Some others are die-hard fans, continuously re-evaluating their ratings throughout the pre-season and congratulating themselves for getting the winner right. Even when the results are disappointing, they come back every year, because not everything is about the songs. The pull is strong and diverse: the travels (real or imagined), the community, 65 years of names and figures luring the statistician in each one of us, the magnificent staging and the lack of shame of it all. Eurovision is a very intense affair, but also a refuge from the outside world. So what if the songs don’t always reflect the “real market”?. Eurovision is a once a year opportunity to oppose the politics of seriousness. Thanks to the Contest, for just one moment in time, being quirky is fine, being passionate is desirable, letting your heart out is celebrated. Eurovision is a product of the bourgeois media, yes, but also a celebration of queerness.

There are many great examples of fan media out there dedicated to following all Eurovision news to the minute: the songs, the qualifying rounds, the betting odds. While this site might feature the occasional review, it will focus on less time-sensitive pieces about Eurovision and its connections with society, politics, the workings of public media, and the LGBTQI community at large. Most of all, it will be an ongoing love letter to my happy place.

## About me

I am an islander born in the Azores, Portugal, in the pre-Internet era. Back when Eurovision and public broadcasters, in general, were the only connection to “the world out there” besides what our emigrant and otherwise travelling relatives would share. The Contest sparked many of my interests that would, later on, lead to career avenues. I have hosted morning radio shows, developed branded content and native advertising for television and digital media, written a few pitches for documentary formats and diven deep into web development. In my spare time, I am an amateur researcher and author in the mythology and spirituality fields. Besides that, I am a poet, a fountain pen nerd and a budding polyglot, currently working my way through German syntax and the Swedish pitch tone. I would move to Ireland in a heartbeat if I could (maybe after the pandemic is over?). But where the ESC is concerned, I am rooting for Italy to win sometime soon.

Fireworks, sequins and Russian grannies, tenors and drag queens, Balearic hairography, timeless ballads and overproduced technopop, human-sized hamster wheels and whatever else the budget will allow. There are “All Kinds of Everything” to enjoy and love in Eurovision. The eponymous song, which gave Ireland its first win ever in the Contest in 1970, is connected to someone who we now know to stand for the opposite of these values of openness and diversity, having worked against the advancement of human rights in Europe. But this too is part of being queer: the ability to claim, time and again, what has been tainted by bigotry and breathe new life into it, transforming insult into pride, “things of the night into sunshine”.

The Eurovision Song Contest is fuelled by passion, enthusiasm and a bit of irreverence, represented by a heart in its current logo. Regardless of the singer’s origin, the language they sing in, or any particular musical genre, (usually) it is their relentless emotion that creates a winning performance. Emotion is what brings millions of people together around something as supposedly vain as a song competition. Here the ESC heart is rendered as a pair of singing lips, which have inspired a couple of previous Contest logos, with a star in the negative space, standing for Europe itself.
